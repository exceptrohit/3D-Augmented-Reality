# 3D-Augmented-Reality
 Marker Based 3D Augmented Reality Application 
# Introduction
Augmented Reality (AR) turns the environment around you into a digital interface by placing virtual objects in the real world, in real-time. AR can be seen through a wide variety of experiences such as gaming applications, AR browsers, etc. <br />  The objective of this project is to design an 3D human figure model with animation and develop an AR application for the same.
The project will include modeling of a human figure using one of the 3D modeling techniques in a software like Unity and the adding animations to the model.
Then we need to integrate the project into an android application which will access the phone camera.

# Marker Based AR
This type of AR, also known as recognition-based AR or image recognition, relies on identification of markers/user-defined images to function. Marker-based AR requires a marker to activate an augmentation. Markers are distinct patterns that cameras can easily recognize and process, and are visually independent of the environment around them; they can be paper-based or physical objects that exist in the real world.
Maker-based AR works by scanning a marker which triggers an augmented experience (whether an object, text, video or animation) to appear on the device.

## Tools Required

- Unity 
- Vuforia 
- Android Studio (SDK)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Blender
## Databse
- The Vuforia Target Manager is a web-based tool that enables us to create and manage target databases on Vuforia’s developer portal. 
- The purpose of Vuforia Device Database – also referred to as datasets in the SDK – is to provide the AR application with a locally accessible database of targets.
- When we have successfully added our targets, we can now download the device database or use the target IDs for our application.
